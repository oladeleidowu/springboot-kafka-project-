Simple Event-Driven Microservices Spring Boot and Apache Kafka.

Basically, I use Apache Kafka as a message broker for Asynchronous communication between multiple microservices.

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can asynchronously publish and subscribe to events via an event broker/message broker.
